<p>For pickleball players or referees 
who have trouble keeping track of the score and the server, 
Pickleball Scorer 
is a web page that automatically keeps score and tells you who is serving. 
Unlike anything that is on the market, 
our product only requires that you enter who won the last point and it does the rest. </p>
